# SudokuProject
A sudoku game implemented using python and pygame.

## Author & credits
This project was made by Javi Barranco. Idea for this project acme from the youtube channel [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg).

## Usage
GraphicSudoku.py is the main script where the game is implemented. To play the game you can either compile and run GraphicSudoku.py or open the build and run the executable with the same name. The Sudoku.py module has the necessary tools to solve sudoku boards. 

## Generating a build
The script setup.py can be used to generate a build.
```bash
python3 setup.py build
```
## What did I learn?
- Extended my knowledge of pygame and python.
- Learned more about recursion and backtracking algorithms.
